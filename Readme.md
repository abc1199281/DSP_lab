# DSP Lab

## Motivation: Simulation in Learning
In this repository, some DSP experiments are provided to **bridge the theory and practice**.

To link the experiment to theory, the layouts of forders follows the outline of [1]. Besides, the experiments which are not covered in the book are located in the folder **other**.

There are several levels for you to explore.
- [Basic] :  
If you're beginner, these experiments are designed for you. It won't be hard. Just relax and give it a try.
- [Middle] :  
If you have learned several concepts of DSP, but sometimes you may be confused by several phenomenon, this class is designed for you. Some experiment in this level are started with a confusing question.
- [Advanced] :  
The concept beyond conventional DSP class are included here. Take up these challanges.
