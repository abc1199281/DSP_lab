# [Middle] Why is the DFT Square not a good PSD Estimation? Inconsistent Estimation.

When taking the random properties into considerationm, there are two basic requirements, **asymptotically unbiased**, and **consistent**.  
This experiment shows the two periodograms estimated using **DFT Square**.  
It is apparent that the variances does not decreases along witht the increase of N.  
Consequently, DFT Square is not a good PSD Estimation.
