# [Basic] What is the definition of biased.

When taking the random properties into considerationm, there are two basic requirements, **asymptotically unbiased**, and **consistent**.  
The definition of **asymptotically unbiased** is shown as follow. The error between estimated mean and real mean approches to zero along with the increasing of N.  
```math
m = \lim_{L \to \infty }\widehat{m}_x=\lim_{L \to \infty }\frac{1}{L}\sum_{n=0}^{L-1}x[n]
```  

This example just shows that when the lenght is larger, the mean is close to its real mean (a.k. asymptotically unbiased).
